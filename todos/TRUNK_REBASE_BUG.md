Title: Trunk rebase bug
Assignee: None
Estimated effort: S
---

Attempting to drag-and-drop the trunk to rebase it gets the UI all glitched up.

1. Dragging the trunk should not be permitted.
2. Dragging a branch that is pointing at the same commit as the trunk (i.e. same row) is not permitted either.
